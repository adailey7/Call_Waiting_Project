Note: I've only done this for windows but it should be the same for mac and linux.

First you'll need to install python. Go here https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-373/ and choose the 
appropriate installer. I'd recommend installing to somewhere accessible like C:\Python37, and make sure pip is included.

Next you'll need to install selenium and behave. To do this, open up your CLI and navigate to Python37\Scripts. 
Enter "pip install -U selenium behave".

You'll also need a webdriver for your browser. If you want the browser to stay open after testing, use firefox.
For firefox: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases
For chrome: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads
Move the webdriver to your scripts folder.

Now you should copy the directory of the features folder (if you pulled it from github, it will be in your github folder).
To run behave, again go to the scripts directory in your CLI and enter "behave [features directory]".

If you're on windows, you may want to create a batch file. To do this make a new file and enter the following with
your respective directories and save it as .bat:
START cmd.exe /k "cd C:\Python37\Scripts & behave C:\Users\Nathan\Documents\GitHub\Call_Waiting_Project\testing\features"
